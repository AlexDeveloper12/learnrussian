# learnrussian
The goal of this project was to aid in my own (and others) personal interest of learning the Russian language. 

I decided to build a page that would contain the Russian alphabet as well as an example of pronunciation.

The app also contains a flatlist which separates different Russian phrases into sections along with an audio file of how to pronounce the phrase.

Furthermore, I implemented SQLLite so users are able to add/delete their own flashcards to help them memorise phrases/words.
